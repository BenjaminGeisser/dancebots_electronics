This board was designed to make programming dozens of ATTinies a bit easier. It provides pads to put the ATTiny on directly to program or a TH socket footprint to solder in a socket that makes programming easier.

It also provides a TH footprint for a header to connect an AVRISP mkII and a footprint for a Wuerth 629105150521 MicroUSB socket to provide target power easily.
